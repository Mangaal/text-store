2. List files in the store
e.g. store ls should list the files in the store
3. Remove a file:
E.g: store rm file.txt should remove file.txt from store
4. Update contents of a file in the store:
E.g: store update file.txt should update contents of file.txt in
server with the local file.txt or create a new file.txt in server if it is
absent.
Bonus: can you skip sending the contents of the file if the server already has it?
5. Support the following operations on files
a. word count: store wc returns the number of words in all the files stored
in server
b. Least or most frequent words:
store freq-words [--limit|-n 10] [--order=dsc|asc]
e.g. store freq-words should return the 10 most frequent words in
all the files combined. This should work the same as running the following
shell command:
cat * | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n |
tail -n 10
Bonus points for optimising to run fast/in parallscssc
